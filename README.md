# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to learn further about R programming and Data technologies and also stats 220 is a compulsory subject to my degree.
- I am interested in learning about Data Visualisation , Gain skills of HTML and CSS and to learn how to solve data science challenges using R programming.
