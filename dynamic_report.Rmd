## Effect of Temperature and Weather Types on the Visibility

- This report tells that how these different factors affect on the **Visibility** such as :
  - Temperature
  - Weather Type
  
  
  
  
- My survey was about to collect the data about *Daily Weather Observations* . In there I collected data about;
  1. Temperature
  2. Humidity
  3. Wind Speed
  4. Weather Type
  5. Visibility


I have created *2 Bar Charts* to show the relationship between **Temperature**, **Weather Type** on **Visibility**




```{r}

#loading data from csv url

csv_file <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQDOfFFR4SL_dCeIpvr_rrdFjkmHGmVdblsf9baVI_DRPOfmDMr2zr6fH2eVAh3ju9UBdk0q093f-HR/pub?gid=1796296273&single=true&output=csv"
logged_data <- read_csv(csv_file) 



#renaming columns for easy references

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(Temperature = 'What is the temperature (In Celcius) this time?',
    Weather = 'What is the general weather condition?',
    Humidity = 'What is the humidity (in %)?',
    Wind_Speed = 'What is the Wind Speed (km/h) ?',
    Visibility = 'What is the Visibility?')



```


```{r}
#Calculating min temp
minimum_temp <- min(latest_data$Temperature, na.rm =TRUE)


#Calculating max temp
maximum_temp <- max(latest_data$Temperature, na.rm =TRUE)


#Calculating Mean Temp and round it to 1 decimal place
mean_temp <- mean(latest_data$Temperature, na.rm=TRUE) %>% round(1)


#Number of rows of Temperature Column
#Total number of observations of Temperature
length_temp <- length(latest_data$Temperature)



```
The **mean temperature** recorded was **`r mean_temp`**째C, the **maximum temperature** was **`r maximum_temp`**째C, and the **minimum temperature** was **`r minimum_temp`**째C.

Additionally, the total number of recorded observations for temperature is **`r length_temp`**.



```{r}
#Number of rows of Visibility as it is categorical only length used.
#Total number of observations of Visibility
length_Visibility <-  length(latest_data$Visibility)

paste0('The Number of Rows in Visibility Column is ', length_Visibility,'.')

```


```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}



#BAR CHART (i) : Comparing Temperature and Visibility
#Create a plot Temperature of the first 10 rows of Temperature in latest_data using the x-axis for the Temperature. 
#And fill the color of each bar using the Visibility.
#using labs to add titles , x and y axis

latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes( x= Temperature,fill= Visibility)) +
  labs(title ="How the Temperature Affects What We See!", 
       subtitle = "Comparing Temperature and Visibility",
       x = 'Temperature (째C)',
       y= 'Number_of_observations')






#BAR CHART (ii): 
#We can see How each Weather Types affects the visibility by creating a bar chart

latest_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes( x= Weather,fill= Visibility)) +
  labs(title ="How the Visibility Changes according to the type of Weather!", 
       subtitle = "Comparing Weather types and Visibility",
       x = 'Weather Type',
       y= 'Number_of_observations')

```


The **Bar chart (i)** shows how Temperature affects Visibility while **Bar chart (ii)** explains how Visibility changes depending on each type of Weather.
